# Daphnia_pulex_Heat_Stress

This repository contains the data and analysis scripts related to the study: "**Delayed transcriptional response of Daphnia pulex to thermal stres**" published in *[Insert Journal]* (DOI: [Insert DOI]).

**Description**

This study investigated the transcriptional response of *Daphnia pulex* to sublethal temperature stress. We aimed to understand how elevated temperatures affect gene expression i, providing insights into their resilience and potential impacts on aquatic ecosystems.

## Data

* **Raw sequencing data:** FASTQ files are available on NCBI SRA under accession number: [Accession Number]
* **Processed data:** 
    * Count matrices, differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and normalized gene expression values are available at the following dryad link [insert link]
